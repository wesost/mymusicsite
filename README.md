My first website - for music

The idea - 
When I listen to a new album, I can add it to the site and make comments/leave a review. Albums from past days go into 
an interactive timeline that shows the album cover and the date listened. Click on the album cover to enlarge and show
comments I left from the day I listened to it. Using html, css, bootstrap
